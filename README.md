# Code Portfolio

A collection of Python and JavaScript scripts I've written for various projects and courses. This portfolio demonstrates my understanding of programming concepts and problem-solving skills, even though I may not write code regularly in my current role.

## Python Scripts

### Data Processing and Automation

- **[fruit_data_processor.py](python/data_processing/fruit_data_processor.py)**: Script that processes text files containing fruit information and uploads the data to a web server. Demonstrates file I/O, data parsing, and HTTP requests.

- **[image_converter.py](python/data_processing/image_converter.py)**: Processes image files by converting them from TIF to JPEG format and resizing them. Shows skills with the Pillow library for image manipulation.

- **[image_uploader.py](python/data_processing/image_uploader.py)**: Uploads processed images to a web server. Demonstrates HTTP POST requests with binary file data.

### Web and Cloud Computing

- **[simple_http_server.py](python/web/simple_http_server.py)**: A simple HTTP server that displays system information. Shows understanding of networking, HTTP servers, and socket programming.

### Security and Validation

- **[username_validator.py](python/security/username_validator.py)**: Contains functions for validating user inputs with specific security requirements. Demonstrates regex pattern matching and input validation best practices.

## JavaScript Scripts

### Data Integration and API

- **[neon_crm_airtable_sync.js](javascript/api_integration/neon_crm_airtable_sync.js)**: Interacts with NeonCRM's API v1 to retrieve membership data and update an Airtable database. Shows skills with API authentication, data transformation, and external service integration.

### Conflict Resolution Logic

- **[reservation_conflict_checker.js](javascript/conflict_detection/reservation_conflict_checker.js)**: Checks for conflicts in a reservation system to prevent double-booking of assets. Demonstrates complex conditional logic, date/time handling, and data manipulation.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Python**: File I/O, HTTP requests, image processing, input validation, web servers
- **JavaScript**: API integration, conflict detection algorithm
- **General Programming**: Error handling, data transformation, modular code organization
- **Tools & Libraries**:  http.server, http, NeonCRM API, OS, Pillow (PIL), requests, re (regex), sys, socket, socketserver

## About These Scripts

These scripts were developed for both professional projects and coursework. While I don't write code daily in my current role, I maintain these skills and understand programming fundamentals, which allows me to communicate effectively with technical teams and solve problems programmatically when needed.

Each script includes comments explaining the purpose and functionality, making it easier to understand the thought process behind the code.
